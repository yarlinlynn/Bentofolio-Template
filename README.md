## 🛠️ Built With
The portfolio is made up of:

- `index.html` – Core structure of the website
- `style.css` – All visual styling, layout, typography, and responsiveness
- `script.js` – Optional JavaScript for interactivity
- **Typed.js** for auto-typing text animation  
  ```html
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/typed.js@2.0.12"></script>
    ```
- SVG icons and graphics embedded in the HTML 

> The SVG animations use `@keyframes`, transitions, and stroke-dash techniques to bring certain graphics to life — subtly but effectively.
